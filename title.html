            <p> On 29th May,2002,just hours before I put the finishing touches to this book, I visited the Grotto in Lourdes,in France, to fill a few bottles with miraculous water from the spring. Inside the Basilica, a gentleman in his seventies said to me, <em>'You know, you look like Paulo Coelho.'</em> 
            I said that <em>I was Paulo Coelho.</em> The man embraced me and introduced to his wife and grand-daughter. He spoke of the importance of my books in his life, concluding: <em>'They make me dream.'</em>
            I have often heard this words before, and they always please me greatly. At that moment, however, I felt really frightened, beacuse I new that my new novel, <em><strong>Eleven Minutes</strong></em>, dealt with a subh=ject that was harsh, difficult, shocking. I went over to the spring, filled my bottles, then came back and asked him where he lived (in northern France, near Belgium) and noted down his name. </p>
        <p>This book is dedicated to you, Maurice Gravelines. I have a duty to you, your wife and grand-daughter and to myself to talk about the things that concern me and not only about what everyone would like to hear. Some books make us dream, others bring us face to face with reality, but what matters most to the author is the honesty with which a book is written.</p>
        <p>
            And,behold, a woman which was in the city, a sinner, and when she knew that Jesus was sitting at meat in the Pharsiee's house, she beought an alabaster cruse of ointment.</p>
        </p>
<p>
    And standing behind at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</p>
<p>
    Now when the Pharsiee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself,saying. This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who, and what manner of woman this is which toucheth him, that she is a sinner.
  </p>
  <p>
      And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</p>
      <p> A certain lender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</p>
      <p>And when they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both.Which of them therefore will love him the most ?</p>
<p>Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most. And he said onto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p>
<p>And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet, but she hath washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</p>
   <p>Thou gavest me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</p> 
  <p>My head with oil thou didst not anoint, but this she hath anointed my feet with ointment.</p>
  <p>Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,the same loveth little.</p>
